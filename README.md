CloudShare Ruby SDK 
=====================

## Description

An SDK for developing applications in Ruby to connect to the CloudShare service using the CloudShare API. 


The SDK includes Ruby methods for the following API activities:

* Creating and Managing Environments and VMs
* Taking Snapshots
* Using CloudFolders
 
The SDK has two modes of use: 

### High Level API

The High Level API (`CSHighApi` class) implements the most popular API calls. It also parses the JSON response blocks into Ruby Hash objects. 
See the example below.

### Low Level API 

The Low Level API (`CSLowApi` class) provides a way to easily create and send API requests. It handles the authentication required
by the CloudShare API. The `call()` method in `CSLowApi` can be used to call the CloudShare API.

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9+
* API-ID (assigned by CloudShare)
* API-KEY (assigned by CloudShare)

## Installation

gem install cloudshare-sdk

## Usage Example

require 'cloudshare-sdk'
api = CloudshareSDK::CSHighApi.new('<API-ID>', '<API-KEY>')
puts api.get_environment_status_list
